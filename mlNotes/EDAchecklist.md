## questions that need answers
#### Prologue
0. RTFM

#### Basics
1. What does it look like? 
2. How much of it is there?
3. What type of data is it?

#### Target Variable
4. target variable: datatype? 
5. target variable: descriptive statistics? 
6. target variable: unbalanced? does it need weighting? 
7. target variable: what sorts of models can predict this? 
8. target variable: is it linearly separable?

#### Feature Data
##### Numeric
9. feature data: independent or dependent?
10. feature data: what are the descriptive statistics of the data? 
11. feature data: is it sparse or dense? 
12. feature data: how much of it is missing/zero? 

##### Graphical
13. feature data: what does it look like when graphed? 
14. feature data: are there outliers? 
15. feature data: are there anomalous patterns? 
16. feature data: what correlations are present between variables? 
17. feature data: is there correlation between features that is worth remarking on? 

##### Decisions
18. feature data: should some be left out?
19. feature data: should some be engineered? 
20. feature data: did the engineering work? what did it do? 

### Remember:
You are not there to gain transcendental understanding - you are there to find out what you need to do in order to train an accurate model.  
There is a difference.  
Both involve understanding and analysing the data.  
One is self involved egotism, the other is useful.
